    <div id="a">
      <p>To date, my blog has been hosted on self-hosted <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. This has irked me for some time ... I'm a software developer and I've always wanted my blog to be powered by something I wrote myself.</p>

      <p>Well, it turns out that I don't have time to do that properly. As a half-way house, I've moved everything to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. It seems like a good compromise as I certainly have more control over the nuts and bolts of the site here, without being mired in Wordpress' arcane PHP code. It also means that the blog is going to be pretty minimalistic ... all the rage these days, isn't it?</p>

      <p>Github users can create a new repository called <code>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.com</code> and it will be accessible at <code>http://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.com</code>. For example, my repository is sitting at <code>http://github.com/yeurch/yeurch.github.com</code> and it's accessible at <code>http://yeurch.github.com/</code>. With some CNAME trickery, I changed the hostname it responds to, making it accessible at <code>http://blog.richardfawcett.net</code> instead.</p>

      <p>When moving to Github, I also took the opportunity to move the blog posts to a new hostname <strong>blog</strong>.richardfawcett.net in order to free up the <code>www.</code> site for other purposes ... eventually some info on my freelancing activities perhaps. For now, <code>www.richardfawcett.net</code> will redirect to <code>blog.richardfawcett.net</code>.</p>
